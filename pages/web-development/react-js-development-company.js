Trying to achieve this sort of functionality yourself would be complicated — but with React you can really cut down on your development time.",

    "The framework is designed to facilitate building reactive UIs that update efficiently when data changes, making it well-suited for apps where the view needs to update dynamically as the underlying data model changes.",
