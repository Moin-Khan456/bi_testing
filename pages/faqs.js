        <>
          When building apps for mobile devices, native development involves
          utilizing the platform-specific languages and tools. Objective-C and
          Swift code is written in Xcode for Apple platforms to produce iOS
          apps. For Android, developers write Java or Kotlin code in Android
          Studio to produce apps. With{" "}

          , a single codebase can generate apps across multiple operating
          systems like iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. The cross-platform
          framework enables writing code once that can then be deployed to the
          different platforms. This prevents needing to rewrite the application
          for each operating system natively.

Once the application gains more users and traction, you can then invest in building out a more robust, responsive website that mirrors the features and functionality of the application. The website and app can be developed in phases, starting with an MVP app and a simple landing page site, then later expanding the features on both platforms in tandem. This allows you to validate the product idea and get to market faster, without needing to build extensive web and mobile platforms upfront before demonstrating product-market fit.",
